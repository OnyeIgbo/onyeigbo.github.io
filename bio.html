  <p>
	 Onye, can be considered as an "Tech enthusiast", she enjoys all things technology from a range of devices such as tablets, mobile phones - all things technology Onye is the one to go to!
  </p>

  <p>It all began when Onye was younger, she was obsessed with Lego; being about to dismantle the piece and be creative in terms of what to build. I beleive that was the beginning of something that was ultimately the start of enthusiam of wanting to be creative. Earlier as a child Onye's mother would call her the 'engineer' of the household as she was the go-to whenever there was an issue from; tablets, devices to even turning on the TV!</p>

  <P>Since then Onye grew this obsession of technology, always up to date with the latest gadgets and wanting to hopefully one day create something as the great Steve Jobs. </P>

  <p>Overall, I belive that Onye was brought into this world to be a creative, inovative , and a problem solver. </p>
